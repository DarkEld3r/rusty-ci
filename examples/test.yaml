# This section holds each scheduler.
# Like the workers section, you may have as many schedulers as youd like.
schedulers:
  # Create a scheduler named `ci-change`
  # This scheduler will trigger the `rusty-ci-test` builder whenever it
  # detects a change in a yaml file for any branch.
  ci-change:
    # This is a regular expression that matches a branch.
    # If there is a change in a branch whos name matches this regex,
    # it will be checked by the following triggers section.
    # THIS WILL ONLY USE THE FIRST REGULAR EXPRESSION IN THIS SECTION TO MATCH THE BRANCH
    branch:
      - ".*"
    # If a change has occurred in a branch that matches the regex in the branch section,
    # Then the files that were changed are matched against the regular expressions in the
    # triggers section. You can have any number of regular expressions in the triggers section.
    # If any one of them matches the name of a file that was changed in a matched branch,
    # then the builders in this scheduler's `builders` section are executed.
    triggers:
      - '.*\.yaml'
      - '.*\.sh'
      - '.*Makefile'
    # This scheduler triggers the `rusty-ci-test` builder.
    # You can put as many builders as youd like here, and the scheduler will start them all.
    builders:

# These are the builders that are executed by the schedulers
# Each has its own specific task that is delegated to one or more workers
# When a builder is run, its script is run on the command line.
# You can have as many builders as youd like as well.
builders:
  # The name of the builder is `rusty-ci-test`
  rusty-ci-test:
    # This is the shell script that the workers will run when this builder is executed
    # You can have as many instructions as youd like
    # Mind you, you cannot use the |, >, <, >>, <<... operators. Sadly, buildbot
    # passes each item separated by whitespace as another parameter to function.
