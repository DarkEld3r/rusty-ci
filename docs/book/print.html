<p>Rusty-CI is just a user interface for <a href="https://buildbot.net">buildbot</a>. Instead of having to write the Python for your CI project to get the versatility you want, just fill out Rusty-CI's template YAML file and it'll do the rest for you.</p>
<a class="header" href="#usage" id="usage"><h2>Usage</h2></a>
<p>Here is the template YAML file that Rusty-CI will output for you to fill out with your own data.</p>
<p>It explains itself for the most part, but I'll be covering it in more detail in a later chapter.</p>

<a class="header" href="#install-python3" id="install-python3"><h3>Install Python3</h3></a>
<p>You're gonna need <a href="https://www.python.org/">python3</a> to use Rusty-CI.</p>
<p>To install on a *nix system, run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">apt install python3-dev
apt install python3-pip
apt install python3-venv
</code></pre>
<p>You will need to be able to use <code>python3 -m pip</code> and <code>python3 -m venv</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#install-rust" id="install-rust"><h3>Install Rust</h3></a>
<p>To install Rusty-CI, you must install Rust.
You if you're on a Unix like platform, can do so by running this shell command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
</code></pre>
<p>If you're on Windows, go to the <a href="https://rust-lang.org">rust website</a>. You'll need to download <code>rust-init.exe</code> and follow its instructions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#install-rusty-ci-with-cargo-recommended" id="install-rusty-ci-with-cargo-recommended"><h3>Install Rusty-CI with Cargo (recommended)</h3></a>
<p>Now that you have Rust, you should be able to install Rusty-CI by running the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo install rusty-ci -f
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically add Rusty-CI to your path, so we should be all done!</p>
<a class="header" href="#build-from-source-more-tedious" id="build-from-source-more-tedious"><h3>Build from source (more tedious)</h3></a>
<p>If you don't want to install with <code>cargo</code>, you can always build Rusty-CI from source. Here's how you would do so.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/rusty-ci

cd rusty-ci
# Cargo will output the executable to ./target/release/rusty-ci
cargo build --release

mv ./target/release/rusty-ci .
</code></pre>
<p>After running these commands, <code>rusty-ci</code> should be in your current working directory. To finish the installation, move the binary to any folder you'd like, and add that folder to your path.</p>
<a class="header" href="#problems-installing" id="problems-installing"><h3>Problems Installing?</h3></a>
<p>If you run into some problems installing Rusty-CI, or if Rust can't find <code>cc</code>, you need to upgrade some of the packages on your system.</p>
<p>Here's the commands I run to solve these errors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>After running these commands, try running <code>cargo install rusty-ci</code> again.</p>

<pre><code>rusty_ci 0.5.2
Adam McDaniel &lt;adam.mcdaniel17@gmail.com&gt;
A continuous integration tool written in Rust

USAGE:
    rusty-ci [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build      Build rusty-ci from an input yaml file
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    install    Install buildbot
    setup      Output a template YAML file for you to change to customize
    start      Launch rusty-ci from an input yaml file
</code></pre>
<p>This tells you more about the program, but it doesn't go into any depth.
Let me explain each subcommand individually.</p>
<a class="header" href="#install-subcommand" id="install-subcommand"><h1>Install Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>The <code>install</code> subcommand is responsible for installing Rusty-CI's dependencies. When you run the install subcommand, it will output a bash script that uses your existing <a href="https://www.python.org/">python3</a> installation to install <a href="https://buildbot.net/">buildbot</a> and its dependencies.</p>
<p>You can also choose to output a makefile instead of a bash script, but it's not really necessary.</p>
<a class="header" href="#usage-2" id="usage-2"><h2>Usage</h2></a>
<p>To output a Makefile for installation, run one of the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Output an install makefile
rusty-ci install --make

# Identical
rusty-ci install -m

# Run the makefile to install
make
</code></pre>
<p>To output a bash script for installation, run one of the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Output an install shell script
rusty-ci install

# Identical
rusty-ci install --bash

# Make the shell script executable
chmod +x ./install.sh
# Run the install script
./install.sh
</code></pre>
<p>If you do decide to either the bash or make buildsystems, be sure to read <code>rusty-ci</code>'s output and follow any instructions given.</p>
<a class="header" href="#setup-subcommand" id="setup-subcommand"><h1>Setup Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>The setup command is very simple. All it does is write a template YAML file to any path you'd like.</p>
<pre><code>$ ./rusty-ci setup
Where do you want the output template yaml to be? out.yaml
Are you sure? (y/n) y
==[INFO]===&gt; Writing template yaml file to out.yaml...
==[INFO]===&gt; All done!
==[INFO]===&gt; Next, run the `install` subcommand command using either the `bash` or `make` flag
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ more out.yaml

</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#build-subcommand" id="build-subcommand"><h1>Build Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>The <code>build</code> subcommand is responsible for constructing the buildbot master, the buildbot workers, and their respective configuration files from a YAML file.</p>
<pre><code>rusty-ci-build 0.1.0
Adam McDaniel &lt;adam.mcdaniel17@gmail.com&gt;
Build rusty-ci from an input yaml file

USAGE:
    rusty-ci build &lt;YAML&gt;

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

ARGS:
    &lt;YAML&gt;    The path to the YAML file
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#usage-3" id="usage-3"><h2>Usage</h2></a>
<p>Before you build your yaml file, you need to get an API or authentication token from your respective Version Control System, and write it to <code>auth.token</code>. This is so the output buildbot project has access to push commit statuses to your repository, and other things like that.</p>
<p>To build from a yaml file, simply run this command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rusty-ci build my_ci.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Now, run the start subcommand.</p>
<a class="header" href="#start-subcommand" id="start-subcommand"><h1>Start Subcommand</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#usage-4" id="usage-4"><h1>Usage</h1></a>
<p>Before doing anything, confirm you're in your venv by running <code>. venv/bin/activate</code>!</p>
<p>After running all the other rusty-ci subcommands, run <code>rusty-ci start YOUR_YAML_FILE.yaml</code></p>
<p>This will kill the master and workers that were previously running, and start new instances of them.</p>
<p>Now, to view your web gui, go to <a href="http://localhost:8010">http://localhost:8010</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#not-working" id="not-working"><h2>Not working?</h2></a>
<p>If your web gui isn't loading, buildbot probably failed to start the master, or you put the wrong IP in the master section of your yaml file.</p>
<p>You probably just forgot to change the path to one of your worker's working directories, though.</p>
<p>To see the log for the master, run <code>tail -f master/twistd.log</code>.</p>
<p>If you see an exception, then the master ran into an error. This error will most likely be self explanatory and easy to debug, but in the case that it isn't, go to the <a href="https://buildbot.net">buildbot website</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#input-yaml" id="input-yaml"><h1>Input YAML</h1></a>
<p>The input YAML file is pretty simple, but here's an explanation of each section individually.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-master-section" id="the-master-section"><h2>The master section</h2></a>
<p>The master section contains the data that controls the master, the bot that controls the workers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># This section holds data specific to the master of the workers
master:
  # The title subsection of the master holds the title of your web gui
  title: &quot;Rusty-CI&quot;
  title-url: &quot;https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/rusty-ci&quot;

  # This is the ip of the web-gui
  # The port is 8010
  webserver-ip: localhost

  # The address of your repository
  repo: &quot;https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/rusty-ci&quot;

  # The number of seconds to wait before checking for updates on your repository
  # Two minutes is a good poll interval
  poll-interval: 120
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#the-merge-request-handler-section" id="the-merge-request-handler-section"><h2>The merge-request-handler section</h2></a>
<p>The merge-request-handler section holds information that determines how <code>buildbot</code> will handle merge and pull requests on your repository.</p>
<p>Right now, this is only supported for <code>github.com</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># This section holds data specific to the handler that will look for
# pull requests / merge requests on your repository
merge-request-handler:
  # This is basically the website you're using for version control
  # Right now, github is the only supported site
  # If you're using an unsupported version control system, no worries,
  # rusty-ci just wont run on pull requests.
  version-control-system: github
  # The username of the owner of the repository
  owner: adam-mcdaniel

  # The name of the repository
  repo-name: rusty-ci

  # You dont want to run arbitrary code on your machine when anyone
  # makes a pull request. Rusty-CI will not test anyone's pull request
  # if their username is not in this list.
  whitelist:
    - adam-mcdaniel

  # The password a whitelisted user can comment on a merge / pull request
  # to mark it for testing; that is if the pull request was made by a non-whitelisted
  # user. If the pull request was made by a whitelisted user, it is automatically run.
  password: &quot;ok to test&quot;
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#the-workers-section" id="the-workers-section"><h2>The workers section</h2></a>
<p>The workers section lists each worker and the information required to construct them and connect them to the master bot.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># This section holds each worker
# You can have as many workers as youd like, just be sure to fill out
# each of their fields out properly.
workers:
  # The name of this worker is `test-worker`
  test-worker:
    # The ip of the master
    masterhost: localhost
    # The port of the master
    # This is not the same as the web gui port!
    masterport: 9989
    # The absolute path to the working directory of this worker
    basedir: &quot;/home/adam/Desktop/rusty-ci/testing/test-worker&quot;
    # The password for this worker
    # This is used by the master to give the worker a job
    password: pass
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#the-schedulers-section" id="the-schedulers-section"><h1>The schedulers section</h1></a>
<p>This section lists each scheduler. Each scheduler has a regular expression that matches a branch to track, and a list of regular expressions that match file changes.</p>
<p>Read the comments in the template YAML for more information.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># This section holds each scheduler.
# Like the workers section, you may have as many schedulers as youd like.
schedulers:
  # Create a scheduler named `ci-change`
  # This scheduler will trigger the `rusty-ci-test` builder whenever it
  # detects a change in a yaml file for any branch.
  ci-change:
    # This is a regular expression that matches a branch.
    # If there is a change in a branch whos name matches this regex,
    # it will be checked by the following triggers section.
    # THIS WILL ONLY USE THE FIRST REGULAR EXPRESSION IN THIS SECTION TO MATCH THE BRANCH
    branch: &quot;.*&quot;
    # If a change has occurred in a branch that matches the regex in the branch section,
    # Then the files that were changed are matched against the regular expressions in the
    # triggers section. You can have any number of regular expressions in the triggers section.
    # If any one of them matches the name of a file that was changed in a matched branch,
    # then the builders in this scheduler's `builders` section are executed.
    triggers:
      - '.*\.yaml'
      - '.*\.sh'
      - &quot;.*Makefile&quot;
    # This scheduler triggers the `rusty-ci-test` builder.
    # You can put as many builders as youd like here, and the scheduler will start them all.
    builders:
      - rusty-ci-test
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#the-builders-section" id="the-builders-section"><h2>The builders section</h2></a>
<p>The builders describe the tasks given to workers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># These are the builders that are executed by the schedulers
# Each has its own specific task that is delegated to one or more workers
# When a builder is run, its script is run on the command line.
# You can have as many builders as youd like as well.
builders:
  # The name of the builder is `rusty-ci-test`
  rusty-ci-test:
    # This is the shell script that the workers will run when this builder is executed
    # You can have as many instructions as youd like
    # Mind you, you cannot use the |, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;... operators. Sadly, buildbot
    # passes each item separated by whitespace as another parameter to function.
    script:
      - echo Hello world!
      - echo Im an instruction in a script!
    # These are the workers to delegate this build job to
    workers:
