<a class="header" href="#installation" id="installation"><h1>Installation</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#install-rust" id="install-rust"><h3>Install Rust</h3></a>
<p>To install Rusty-CI, you must install Rust.
You if you're on a Unix like platform, can do so by running this shell command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
</code></pre>
<p>If you're on Windows, go to the <a href="https://rust-lang.org">rust website</a>. You'll need to download <code>rust-init.exe</code> and follow its instructions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#install-rusty-ci-with-cargo-recommended" id="install-rusty-ci-with-cargo-recommended"><h3>Install Rusty-CI with Cargo (recommended)</h3></a>
<p>Now that you have Rust, you should be able to install Rusty-CI by running the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo install rusty-ci -f
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically add Rusty-CI to your path, so we should be all done!</p>
<a class="header" href="#build-from-source-more-tedious" id="build-from-source-more-tedious"><h3>Build from source (more tedious)</h3></a>
<p>If you don't want to install with <code>cargo</code>, you can always build Rusty-CI from source. Here's how you would do so.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/rusty-ci

cd rusty-ci
# Cargo will output the executable to ./target/release/rusty-ci
cargo build --release

mv ./target/release/rusty-ci .
</code></pre>
<p>After running these commands, <code>rusty-ci</code> should be in your current working directory. To finish the installation, move the binary to any folder you'd like, and add that folder to your path.</p>
<a class="header" href="#problems-installing" id="problems-installing"><h3>Problems Installing?</h3></a>
<p>If you run into some problems installing Rusty-CI, or if Rust can't find <code>cc</code>, you need to upgrade some of the packages on your system.</p>
<p>Here's the commands I run to solve these errors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential
</code></pre>
<p>After running these commands, try running <code>cargo install rusty-ci</code> again.</p>
<a class="header" href="#still-having-problems" id="still-having-problems"><h3>Still having problems?</h3></a>
<p>If you're still having some serious problems, <a href="https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/rusty-ci/issues">post an issue</a> on the repository.</p>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="#help-subcommand" id="help-subcommand"><h1>Help Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>Rusty-CI has four subcommands, the first of which is the <code>help</code> subcommand.
To run the help subcommand, run <code>rusty-ci help</code> or alternatively <code>rusty-ci</code>.
If you dont provide any arguments to <code>rusty-ci</code>, it will print the help message by default.</p>
<pre><code>rusty_ci 0.4.2
Adam McDaniel &lt;adam.mcdaniel17@gmail.com&gt;
A continuous integration tool written in Rust

USAGE:
    rusty-ci [FLAGS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -b, --bash       Uses bash to install and build rusty-ci's output
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -m, --make       Uses make to install and build rusty-ci's output
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build      Build and launch rusty-ci from an input yaml file
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    install    Install python3 and buildbot
    setup      Output a template YAML file for you to change to customize
</code></pre>
<p>This tells you more about the program, but it doesn't go into any depth.
Let me explain each subcommand individually.</p>
<a class="header" href="#install-subcommand" id="install-subcommand"><h1>Install Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>The <code>install</code> subcommand is responsible for installing Rusty-CI's dependencies. When you run the install subcommand, it will run several shell commands in the background to install <a href="https://www.python.org/">python3</a>, and <a href="https://buildbot.net/">buildbot</a>.</p>
<p>That is, if you use the default buildsystem. If you do not want Rusty-CI running anything on your machine without supervision, you can choose from the other buildsystems. Right now, <code>Rusty-CI</code> supports writing a Makefile, or writing a shell script to install dependencies. More buildsystems should be added in the future.</p>
<a class="header" href="#usage-2" id="usage-2"><h2>Usage</h2></a>
<p>To output a Makefile for installation, run one of the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Output an install makefile
rusty-ci --make install

# Identical
rusty-ci -m install

# Run the makefile to install
make
</code></pre>
<p>To output a bash script for installation, run one of the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Output an install makefile
rusty-ci --bash install

# Identical
rusty-ci -b install

# Make the shell script executable
chmod +x ./install.sh
# Run the install script
./install.sh
</code></pre>
<p>If you do decide to either the bash or make buildsystems, be sure to read <code>rusty-ci</code>'s output and follow any instructions given.</p>
<a class="header" href="#after-installing" id="after-installing"><h4>After installing</h4></a>
<p>For some reason, when <code>pip</code> and <code>apt</code> fail to install an application, they don't seem to return a non-zero exit code. This makes it difficult to capture errors and debug your installation problems.</p>
<p>Even if Rusty-CI tells you it has succeeded installing its dependencies, be sure to verify this using the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Each of these should output a help message
python3 -m venv
buildbot
buildbot-worker
</code></pre>
<p>If any of these do not display a help message, rerun the <code>install</code> subcommand and <em><strong>read every line of output from rusty-ci</strong></em>. There might be an instruction or a warning that you missed!</p>
<a class="header" href="#setup-subcommand" id="setup-subcommand"><h1>Setup Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>The setup command is very simple. All it does is write a template YAML file to any path you'd like.</p>
<pre><code>$ ./rusty-ci setup
Where do you want the output template yaml to be? out.yaml
Are you sure? (y/n) y
==[INFO]===&gt; Writing template yaml file to out.yaml...
==[INFO]===&gt; All done!

</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#build-subcommand" id="build-subcommand"><h1>Build Subcommand</h1></a>
<p>The <code>build</code> subcommand is responsible for constructing the buildbot master, the buildbot workers, and their respective configuration files from a YAML file.</p>
<p>The build subcommand can also be used with different buildsystems. However, every system for building currently uses the same underlying code for building, so there's really no benefit to using a particular build system for now.</p>
<a class="header" href="#usage-3" id="usage-3"><h2>Usage</h2></a>
<p>To build from a yaml file, simply run this command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rusty-ci build my_ci.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to view your web gui, go to <a href="http://localhost:8010">http://localhost:8010</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#not-working" id="not-working"><h2>Not working?</h2></a>
<p>If your web gui isn't loading, buildbot probably failed to start the master, or you put the wrong IP in the master section of your yaml file.</p>
<p>You probably just forgot to change the path to one of your worker's working directories, though.</p>
<p>To see the log for the master, run <code>tail master/twistd.log</code>.</p>
<p>If you see an exception, then the master ran into an error. This error will most likely be self explanatory and easy to debug, but in the case that it isn't, go to the <a href="https://buildbot.net">buildbot website</a>.</p>

<a class="header" href="#the-master-section" id="the-master-section"><h2>The master section</h2></a>
<p>The master section contains the data that controls the master, the bot that controls the workers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># This section holds data specific to the master of the workers
master:
  # The title subsection of the master holds the title of your web gui

<a class="header" href="#the-merge-request-handler-section" id="the-merge-request-handler-section"><h2>The merge-request-handler section</h2></a>
<p>The merge-request-handler section holds information that determines how <code>buildbot</code> will handle merge and pull requests on your repository.</p>

<a class="header" href="#the-schedulers-section" id="the-schedulers-section"><h1>The schedulers section</h1></a>
<p>This section lists each scheduler. Each scheduler has a regular expression that matches a branch to track, and a list of regular expressions that match file changes.</p>

    branch:

    # If a change has occurred in a branch that matches the regex in the branch section,
    # Then the files that were changed are matched against the regular expressions in the
